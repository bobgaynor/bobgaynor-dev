      <h2><a href="projects/cta.html">Cyber Threat Analyzer (CTA) — Interactive Demo</a></h2>
      <p>An end-to-end data pipeline that ingests raw security logs, enriches them with threat intelligence, and uses a machine learning model to identify brute force activity. Built to show how data engineering, security analytics, and ML can work together in a single workflow.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cloud Infrastructure Automation</h2>
      <p>A project using Infrastructure as Code to deploy and manage a secure cloud environment for a standard web application. Focuses on repeatability, minimal configuration drift, and clear separation between network, compute, and application layers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security Data Visualization</h2>
      <p>A set of visualizations designed to explore security datasets and highlight trends, anomalies, and patterns. Emphasis on clarity, interaction, and practical use in analysis workflows.</p>
